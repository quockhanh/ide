Rockmelon QA uses Github as code and installer repositories

Reference to [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) for the configuration in `package.json`.

GitHub [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required. You can generate by going to [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). The access token should have the **repo scope/permission**

# 1 Windows installer

- In Ubuntu, need to `sudo apt install wine` first.
- If you want to create `*.exe` installer locally, then execute `npm run out:win`. The installer is under `release/build` folder.
- If you want to create `*.exe` installer then publish to Github:
  - Register `GH_TOKEN` envinment variable by `export GH_TOKEN=<your-access-token-here>`. You can check it again by `printenv GH_TOKEN`
  - Execute `npm run publish:win` to create the installer, then publish Github.
  - Visit [Rockmelon's release page](https://github.com/rockmelonqa/ide/releases), select new release, edit, then publish it. (We need this step to enable auto update, and people who are not contributors can download via direct link)

(If we want to create and publish all installers, let's run `npm run publish:all`)

# 2 MacOS installer

(TODO)

# 3 Linux installer

- Same as Windows installer but let's use `npm run out:linux` or `npm run publish:linux`
